This Package was archived on CRAN.  I am resurrecting it.
I have Jim Lindsey's permission to be maintainer of his packages on CRAN.  Currently he has them in .zip files on his homepage:  http://www.commanster.eu/rcode.html.  He does not have access to the original email address he used when this package was on CRAN, and thus cannot send a separate confirmation email.  However, you can contact him at James Lindsey <jlindsey@gen.unimaas.nl>.  

He sent this confirmation message on 2016-11-24:

Dear CRAN,

Bruce Swihart is taking on the role of maintainer for my R-packages which have been available on my homepage, http://www.commanster.eu/rcode.html.  Some of these R-packages were on CRAN but have since been archived. 
I know it is CRAN repository policy to email confirmation from the previous maintainer's email address (jlindsey@luc.ac.be), but alas I can't due to LUC changing its name.

Please accept this email as confirmation of the maintainer role changing for R packages 'rmutil', 'repeated', 'gnlm', 'growth', 'event', 'stable'.

Regards,
Jim Lindsey
